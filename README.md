In short, this project is a simple console program that demonstrates the four basic data management operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD). Through interactive menus, users can add new data entries, view all stored data, modify existing entries, and delete them from the system. The program is designed flexibly to manage multiple different data types, each with its own unique attributes.
